      <description>Microsoft recently performed a patch for Kerberos and the KDC service on domain controllers. This would patch a heavy vulnerability in the Kerberos signing structure. However, this presented a problem with our domain joined Qumulo storage appliance, and disallowed any users from authenticating to SMB shares. In order to alleviate ourselves of the issue, we followed the instructions to disable the following registry key within HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Kdc\ by adding PerformTicketSignature set to DWORD 0.</description>
