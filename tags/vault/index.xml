      <description>Being a good SysAdmin requires some sense of laziness. In the spirit of that approach, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent some time looking into Hashicorp&amp;rsquo;s Terraform and Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s Ansible tools in my organization&amp;rsquo;s route to Google Cloud Platform. I wanted a method to create reproducable Copute Engine VMs that would allow us to easily create multiple hosts with minor changes quickly and easily.
I decided that with the use of Terraform, Vault (also from Hashicorp) would allow me to templatize the configs, as well as, create secrets/passwords that would be randomized, able to be called at will, and even automatically rolled with a configured frequency.</description>
